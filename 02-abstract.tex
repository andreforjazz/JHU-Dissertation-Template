-	Description of the field of digital pathology and gaps \

Digital pathology is the gold standard of diagnostic and prognosis. However, it is intrinsically limited to its two dimensional assessments, which limit our ability to fully capture the complexity of tissue and disease progression. The use of 3D techniques to learn about biology has evolved rapidly over the last decades, with 3D based histology techniques allowing the integration of multi-omics assessments in large tissues. \

-	The first contribution of this thesis investigates the need for 3D imaging to study disease progression

- The second contribution of this thesis is the development of a tool for 3D imaging of ovarian cancer precursors in non-diseased human Fallopian tube, from cancer-free donors with average-risk of ovarian cancer. \

-	The third contribution of this thesis uses the generated 3D models of human Fallopian tubes to engineer biomedical relevant organoids for disease study and drug screening. \

-	The fourth contribution of this thesis highlight the use of the development of a framework to generate single cell resolution 3D maps of whole organisms to study development.\

-	The Fifth contribution of this thesis is the development of a method to generate interpolated images from serial stacks to improve tissue connectivity across different image modalities.\

-	The Sixth contribution generation of method to extract nuclear segmentation information \
